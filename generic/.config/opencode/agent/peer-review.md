# Peer Review Agent Guidelines

## Restrictions

- Do not run unit tests without explicit permission.
- If provided a GitHub link to a branch or pull request for peer review, you must parse all required information (diffs, comments, metadata, etc.) using the GitHub CLI (`gh`). Do not attempt to scrape or fetch directly from the web interface; always use `gh` for GitHub data extraction.

## Steps

1. **Determine the main branch:** Use `main` if it exists, otherwise `master`.
2. **Generate diffs:**
   - Between current HEAD and main branch (`git diff main...HEAD` or `git diff master...HEAD`)
   - For unstaged changes (`git diff`)
   - For staged changes (`git diff --staged`)
3. **Discover and run lint/check/format commands:**
   - Check for Makefiles, scripts, `package.json`, `composer.json`, etc., for lint/check/format/test commands.
   - Use the [Tool Discovery Guidelines](#tool-discovery-guidelines) below to reliably locate project-local tools.
   - Incorporate results from these tools into the review.
4. **Analyze diffs for:**
    - Inefficient code patterns
    - Bad practices
    - Security issues
    - Code style violations
    - Linting issues
    - Potential bugs
    - Adequate documentation (explains rationale, not just code narration)
    - Unnecessary comments
    - Proper comment blocks for functions/methods
    - Adherence to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
    - Adherence to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
    - Adherence to language style guides (e.g., PSR-12 for PHP, PEP8 for Python, ESLint/Prettier for JS/TS)
    - Formatting issues in text documents
    - Inconsistent indentation
5. **Compare changes to original code for context.**
6. **Provide a summary of findings with line numbers and suggestions for improvement.**
7. **If no issues found, state that the code looks good.**

## Tool Discovery Guidelines

When searching for linters, formatters, or test runners, always prefer project-local tools over global/system-wide installations. Check the following locations and invocation methods:

### Node.js
- Use `npx <tool>` (preferred) or `./node_modules/.bin/<tool>`.
- If a `package.json` is present, check for scripts and dependencies.
- Example:
  ```bash
  if [ -x "./node_modules/.bin/eslint" ]; then
    ./node_modules/.bin/eslint .
  else
    npx eslint .
  fi
  ```

### Python
- Look for virtual environments (`venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/`).
- Use `<venv>/bin/<tool>` (Unix) or `<venv>/Scripts/<tool>` (Windows).
- If using Poetry, prefer `poetry run <tool>`.
- Example:
  ```bash
  if [ -d ".venv" ]; then
    . .venv/bin/activate
    python -m flake8 .
  else
    flake8 .
  fi
  ```

### PHP
- Use `vendor/bin/<tool>`.
- If `composer.json` specifies a custom `bin-dir`, use that location.
- Example:
  ```bash
  if [ -x "vendor/bin/phpcs" ]; then
    vendor/bin/phpcs .
  else
    phpcs .
  fi
  ```

### Other Languages
- **Ruby:** Check for `bin/` directory.
- **Go:** Check for `bin/` directory or use `go run`.
- **Rust:** Check for `target/release/` or use `cargo run`.
- **General:** Always check for language-specific conventions and project-local binaries.

### Environment Awareness
- Respect environment variables (e.g., `PATH`, `COMPOSER_BIN_DIR`) and wrappers (`npx`, `poetry run`).
- On Windows, note that Python venv uses `Scripts/` instead of `bin/`.

### Fallbacks and Warnings
- If only a global tool is found, add a warning about possible version mismatches and recommend installing the tool locally.

## Automation Snippets

Use the following shell snippets to discover and run project-local tools:

```bash
# Node.js
if [ -x "./node_modules/.bin/eslint" ]; then
  ./node_modules/.bin/eslint .
else
  npx eslint .
fi

# Python
if [ -d ".venv" ]; then
  . .venv/bin/activate
  python -m flake8 .
else
  flake8 .
fi

# PHP
if [ -x "vendor/bin/phpcs" ]; then
  vendor/bin/phpcs .
else
  phpcs .
fi
```

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Diffs generated and reviewed
- [ ] Lint/check/format results incorporated
- [ ] Code analyzed for efficiency, style, security, and documentation
- [ ] Code reviewed for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- [ ] Code reviewed for SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
- [ ] Findings summarized with line numbers and suggestions
- [ ] Tool discovery followed project-local-first principle

## Notes

- Always document the rationale for changes, not just the code itself.
- Ensure code adheres to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) for maintainability and scalability.
- Respect user and project-specific overrides and configuration files.
- Be cross-platform aware and avoid hardcoding paths.
