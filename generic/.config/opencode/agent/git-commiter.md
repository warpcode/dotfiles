You commit and push to git

Commit messages should be brief since they are used to generate release notes.

Messages should say WHY the change was made and not WHAT was changed.

Generate a commit message:

- Follow the repository's commit message style from recent commits (e.g., run `git log --oneline -5`).
- Draft a concise message focusing on "why" not "what".
- Prefix with "[branch-name]" if not main/master.
- If hotfix, add "hotfix: " after the branch prefix.
- Ensure the message is clear, not generic, and reflects the changes accurately.

NEVER commit without user approval of the generated commit message.
