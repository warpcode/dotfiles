# Skill Creation Process

Skill creation involves these steps:

1. Understand the skill with concrete examples
2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)
3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)
4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)
5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)
6. Iterate based on real usage

Follow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.

Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

First, determine where to create the Skill:

**Personal Skills**:
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/`
- opencode: `~/.config/opencode/skills/`
- Individual workflows and preferences
- Experimental Skills
- Personal productivity tools

**Project Skills**:
- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/`
- opencode: `.opencode/skills/`
- Team workflows and conventions
- Project-specific expertise
- Shared utilities (committed to git)

To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly

Example: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like "Help me rotate this PDF," the analysis shows:

1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like "Build me a todo app" or "Build me a dashboard to track my steps," the analysis shows:

1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time
2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like "How many users have logged in today?" the analysis shows:

1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time
2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill

To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.

### Step 3: Initializing the Skill

At this point, it is time to actually create the skill.

Skip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.

When creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.

Usage:

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

The script:

- Creates the skill directory at the specified path
- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders
- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`
- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted

After initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.

Alternatively, create the skill structure manually:

```bash
# Personal
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/skill-name  # Claude Code
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/skill-name  # opencode

# Project
mkdir -p .claude/skills/skill-name  # Claude Code
mkdir -p .opencode/skills/skill-name  # opencode
```

For multi-file Skills:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── reference.md (optional)
├── examples.md (optional)
├── scripts/
│   └── helper.py (optional)
└── templates/
    └── template.txt (optional)
```

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

When editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.

#### Learn Proven Design Patterns

Consult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:

- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic
- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns

These files contain established best practices for effective skill design.

#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.

Added scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.

Any example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.

#### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.

##### Frontmatter

Create YAML frontmatter with required fields:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this does and when to use it
---
```

**Field requirements**:

- **name**:
  - Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
  - Max 64 characters
  - Must match directory name
  - Good: `pdf-processor`, `git-commit-helper`
  - Bad: `PDF_Processor`, `Git Commits!`

- **description**:
  - Max 1024 characters
  - Include BOTH what it does AND when to use it
  - Use specific trigger words users would say
  - Mention file types, operations, and context

**Optional frontmatter fields**:

- **allowed-tools**: Restrict tool access (comma-separated list)
  ```yaml
  allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
  ```
  Use for:
  - Read-only Skills
  - Security-sensitive workflows
  - Limited-scope operations

The description is critical for Claude to discover your Skill. The description is what the AI uses to help decide to use that skill. So the descriptions must be very specific in when the skill should be used.

**Formula**: `[What it does] + [When to use it] + [Key triggers]`

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**:
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

✅ **Good**:
```yaml
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, and generate charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or analyzing tabular data in .xlsx format.
```

❌ **Too vague**:
```yaml
description: Helps with documents
description: For data analysis
```

**Tips**:
- Include specific file extensions (.pdf, .xlsx, .json)
- Mention common user phrases ("analyze", "extract", "generate")
- List concrete operations (not generic verbs)
- Add context clues ("Use when...", "For...")

Do not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.

##### Body

Use clear Markdown sections:

```markdown
# Skill Name

Brief overview of what this Skill does.

## Quick start

Provide a simple example to get started immediately.

## Instructions

Step-by-step guidance for Claude:
1. First step with clear action
2. Second step with expected outcome
3. Handle edge cases

## Examples

```

Write instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.

### Step 5: Packaging a Skill

Once development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>
```

Optional output directory specification:

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist
```

The packaging script will:

1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:

   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields
   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure
   - Description completeness and quality
   - File organization and resource references

2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.

If validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.

### Step 6: Iterate

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.

**Iteration workflow:**

1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again
