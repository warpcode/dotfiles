# Skill Writer

This Skill helps you create well-structured Agent Skills for AI coding assistants like Claude Code and opencode that follow best practices and validation requirements.

## When to use this Skill

Use this Skill when:
- Creating a new Agent Skill
- Writing or updating SKILL.md files
- Designing skill structure and frontmatter
- Troubleshooting skill discovery issues
- Converting existing prompts or workflows into Skills

## Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

Every SKILL.md consists of:

- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.
- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

Use bundled resources judiciously:

- **Simple skills**: Only create SKILL.md
- **Large/complex skills**: Use SKILL.md as a router to reference markdown files broken down into specific tasks/areas/rules of expertise
- **Scripts**: Very rarely used, only when scripts are the ONLY way to accomplish something

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified
- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context

#### What to Not Include in a Skill

A skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:

- README.md
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- etc.

The skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)

#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns

Keep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.

**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.

**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]

## Advanced features

- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
```

Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.

**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**

For Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

When a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.

Similarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:

```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)
    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)
    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)
```

When the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.

**Pattern 3: Conditional details**

Show basic content, link to advanced content:

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents

Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents

For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.

**Important guidelines:**

- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.
- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.

## Skill Creation Process

Skill creation involves these steps:

1. Understand the skill with concrete examples
2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)
3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)
4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)
5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)
6. Iterate based on real usage

Follow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.

Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

First, determine where to create the Skill:

**Personal Skills**:
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/`
- opencode: `~/.config/opencode/skills/`
- Individual workflows and preferences
- Experimental Skills
- Personal productivity tools

**Project Skills**:
- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/`
- opencode: `.opencode/skills/`
- Team workflows and conventions
- Project-specific expertise
- Shared utilities (committed to git)

To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly

Example: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like "Help me rotate this PDF," the analysis shows:

1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like "Build me a todo app" or "Build me a dashboard to track my steps," the analysis shows:

1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time
2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like "How many users have logged in today?" the analysis shows:

1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time
2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill

To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.

### Step 3: Initializing the Skill

At this point, it is time to actually create the skill.

Skip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.

When creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.

Usage:

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

The script:

- Creates the skill directory at the specified path
- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders
- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`
- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted

After initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.

Alternatively, create the skill structure manually:

```bash
# Personal
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/skill-name  # Claude Code
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/skill-name  # opencode

# Project
mkdir -p .claude/skills/skill-name  # Claude Code
mkdir -p .opencode/skills/skill-name  # opencode
```

For multi-file Skills:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── reference.md (optional)
├── examples.md (optional)
├── scripts/
│   └── helper.py (optional)
└── templates/
    └── template.txt (optional)
```

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

When editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.

#### Learn Proven Design Patterns

Consult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:

- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic
- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns

These files contain established best practices for effective skill design.

#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.

Added scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.

Any example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.

#### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.

##### Frontmatter

Create YAML frontmatter with required fields:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this does and when to use it
---
```

**Field requirements**:

- **name**:
  - Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
  - Max 64 characters
  - Must match directory name
  - Good: `pdf-processor`, `git-commit-helper`
  - Bad: `PDF_Processor`, `Git Commits!`

- **description**:
  - Max 1024 characters
  - Include BOTH what it does AND when to use it
  - Use specific trigger words users would say
  - Mention file types, operations, and context

**Optional frontmatter fields**:

- **allowed-tools**: Restrict tool access (comma-separated list)
  ```yaml
  allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
  ```
  Use for:
  - Read-only Skills
  - Security-sensitive workflows
  - Limited-scope operations

The description is critical for Claude to discover your Skill. The description is what the AI uses to help decide to use that skill. So the descriptions must be very specific in when the skill should be used.

**Formula**: `[What it does] + [When to use it] + [Key triggers]`

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**:
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

✅ **Good**:
```yaml
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, and generate charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or analyzing tabular data in .xlsx format.
```

❌ **Too vague**:
```yaml
description: Helps with documents
description: For data analysis
```

**Tips**:
- Include specific file extensions (.pdf, .xlsx, .json)
- Mention common user phrases ("analyze", "extract", "generate")
- List concrete operations (not generic verbs)
- Add context clues ("Use when...", "For...")

Do not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.

##### Body

Use clear Markdown sections:

```markdown
# Skill Name

Brief overview of what this Skill does.

## Quick start

Provide a simple example to get started immediately.

## Instructions

Step-by-step guidance for Claude:
1. First step with clear action
2. Second step with expected outcome
3. Handle edge cases

## Examples

Show concrete usage examples with code or commands.

## Best practices

- Key conventions to follow
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- When to use vs. not use

## Requirements

List any dependencies or prerequisites:
```bash
pip install package-name
```

## Advanced usage

For complex scenarios, see [reference.md](reference.md).
```

Write instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.

### Step 5: Packaging a Skill

Once development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>
```

Optional output directory specification:

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist
```

The packaging script will:

1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:

   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields
   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure
   - Description completeness and quality
   - File organization and resource references

2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.

If validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.

### Step 6: Iterate

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.

**Iteration workflow:**

1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again

## Validation and Testing

### Validate the Skill

Check these requirements:

✅ **File structure**:
- [ ] SKILL.md exists in correct location
- [ ] Directory name matches frontmatter `name`

✅ **YAML frontmatter**:
- [ ] Opening `---` on line 1
- [ ] Closing `---` before content
- [ ] Valid YAML (no tabs, correct indentation)
- [ ] `name` follows naming rules
- [ ] `description` is specific and < 1024 chars

✅ **Content quality**:
- [ ] Clear instructions for Claude
- [ ] Concrete examples provided
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Dependencies listed (if any)

✅ **Testing**:
- [ ] Description matches user questions
- [ ] Skill activates on relevant queries
- [ ] Instructions are clear and actionable

### Test the Skill

1. **Restart your AI assistant** (Claude Code or opencode if running) to load the Skill

2. **Ask relevant questions** that match the description:
   ```
   Can you help me extract text from this PDF?
   ```

3. **Verify activation**: Claude should use the Skill automatically

4. **Check behavior**: Confirm Claude follows the instructions correctly

### Debug if needed

If Claude doesn't use the Skill:

1. **Make description more specific**:
   - Add trigger words
   - Include file types
   - Mention common user phrases

2. **Check file location**:
   ```bash
   # Claude Code
   ls ~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
   ls .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md

   # opencode
   ls ~/.config/opencode/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
   ls .opencode/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
   ```

3. **Validate YAML**:
   ```bash
   cat SKILL.md | head -n 10
   ```

4. **Run debug mode**:
   ```bash
   claude --debug  # Claude Code
   opencode --debug  # opencode
   ```

## Common patterns

### Read-only Skill

```yaml
---
name: code-reader
description: Read and analyze code without making changes. Use for code review, understanding codebases, or documentation.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

### Script-based Skill

```yaml
---
name: data-processor
description: Process CSV and JSON data files with Python scripts. Use when analyzing data files or transforming datasets.
---

# Data Processor

## Instructions

1. Use the processing script:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/process.py input.csv --output results.json
\`\`\`

2. Validate output with:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/validate.py results.json
\`\`\`
```

### Multi-file Skill with progressive disclosure

```yaml
---

---

# API Designer

Quick start: See [examples.md](examples.md)

Detailed reference: See [reference.md](reference.md)

## Instructions

1. Gather requirements
2. Design endpoints (see examples.md)
3. Document with OpenAPI spec
4. Review against best practices (see reference.md)
```

## Common patterns

### Read-only Skill

```yaml
---
name: code-reader
description: Read and analyze code without making changes. Use for code review, understanding codebases, or documentation.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

### Script-based Skill

```yaml
---
name: data-processor
description: Process CSV and JSON data files with Python scripts. Use when analyzing data files or transforming datasets.
---

# Data Processor

## Instructions

1. Use the processing script:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/process.py input.csv --output results.json
\`\`\`

2. Validate output with:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/validate.py results.json
\`\`\`
```

### Multi-file Skill with progressive disclosure

```yaml
---
name: api-designer
description: Design REST APIs following best practices. Use when creating API endpoints, designing routes, or planning API architecture.
---

# API Designer

Quick start: See [examples.md](examples.md)

Detailed reference: See [reference.md](reference.md)

## Instructions

1. Gather requirements
2. Design endpoints (see examples.md)
3. Document with OpenAPI spec
4. Review against best practices (see reference.md)
```

## Best practices for Skill authors

1. **One Skill, one purpose**: Don't create mega-Skills
2. **Specific descriptions**: Include trigger words users will say
3. **Clear instructions**: Write for Claude, not humans
4. **Concrete examples**: Show real code, not pseudocode
5. **List dependencies**: Mention required packages in description
6. **Test with teammates**: Verify activation and clarity
7. **Version your Skills**: Document changes in content
8. **Use progressive disclosure**: Put advanced details in separate files
9. **Be concise**: The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request. Default assumption: Claude is already very smart. Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does Claude really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?" Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.
10. **Set appropriate degrees of freedom**: Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability. High freedom (text-based instructions): Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach. Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters): Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior. Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters): Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed. Think of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

## Validation checklist

Before finalizing a Skill, verify:

- [ ] Name is lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars
- [ ] Description is specific and < 1024 chars
- [ ] Description includes "what" and "when"
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is valid
- [ ] Instructions are step-by-step
- [ ] Examples are concrete and realistic
- [ ] Dependencies are documented
- [ ] File paths use forward slashes
- [ ] Skill activates on relevant queries
- [ ] Claude follows instructions correctly

## Troubleshooting

**Skill doesn't activate**:
- Make description more specific with trigger words
- Include file types and operations in description
- Add "Use when..." clause with user phrases

**Multiple Skills conflict**:
- Make descriptions more distinct
- Use different trigger words
- Narrow the scope of each Skill

**Skill has errors**:
- Check YAML syntax (no tabs, proper indentation)
- Verify file paths (use forward slashes)
- Ensure scripts have execute permissions
- List all dependencies

## Examples

See the documentation for complete examples:
- Simple single-file Skill (commit-helper)
- Skill with tool permissions (code-reviewer)
- Multi-file Skill (pdf-processing)

## Output format

When creating a Skill, I will:

1. Ask clarifying questions about scope and requirements
2. Suggest a Skill name and location
3. Create the SKILL.md file with proper frontmatter
4. Include clear instructions and examples
5. Add supporting files if needed
6. Provide testing instructions
7. Validate against all requirements

The result will be a complete, working Skill that follows all best practices and validation rules for Claude Code and opencode.
