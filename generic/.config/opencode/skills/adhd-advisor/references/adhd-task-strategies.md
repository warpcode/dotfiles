# ADHD Task Strategies

## Universal ADHD-Friendly Strategies

Reduce overwhelm, manage executive function challenges, promote focus.

### Time Management
- **pomodoro technique**: 25-minute focused sessions + 5-minute breaks. Enforce with timer.
- **time estimates**: Subtasks ≤ 15-30 minutes. Maintain momentum, avoid procrastination.

### Task Structuring
- **done criteria**: Concrete "done" indicators per subtask (e.g., "You are done when...")
- **sequenced steps**: Subtasks logically. Dependencies clear.

### Focus and Distraction Control
- **distraction minimization**: "Do Not Disturb" mode or remove phone access before starting.
- **focus locks**: Explicitly state what NOT to do (e.g., "Ignore unrelated code for now").

### Motivation and Support
- **gamification**: Tasks as "missions" or "challenges". Make engaging.
- **encouragement**: End with supportive, empowering language. Build confidence.

### Breaks and Recovery
- **scheduled breaks**: "Take a 5-minute break" steps between larger chunks.
- **no refactoring detours**: Stick to mission, avoid side tasks.

Use with domain-specific breakdowns for optimal results.
