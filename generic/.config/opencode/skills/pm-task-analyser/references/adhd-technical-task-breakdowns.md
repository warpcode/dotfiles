# ADHD Technical Task Breakdowns

## Overview
Use this guide for breaking down specific, technical software development tasks (e.g., features, bug fixes) into hyper-specific, small coding steps. Requires reading the codebase to formulate plans.

## Process
1. **Acknowledge and Clarify:** Restate the goal to confirm understanding.
2. **Investigate Codebase:** Use read/grep to find relevant files (controllers, models, services).
3. **Formulate Plan:** Break into subtasks (ideally 25 min each), avoiding ambiguity.

## Subtask Structure
For each:
- **Objective:** Clear goal sentence.
- **File(s) to Open:** Exact paths.
- **Action:** Numbered, specific changes.
- **Verification:** Concrete "You are done when..." statement.

## ADHD Strategies
See adhd-task-strategies.md for universal tactics (Pomodoro, focus locks, encouragement).

## Examples
- **Add Pagination to API:** Subtask 1: Open controller, add $perPage parameter; done when endpoint returns paginated results.
- **Fix Bug:** Subtask 1: Grep for error location; done when stack trace resolved.

End with encouragement.
