# ADHD Task Strategies

## Universal ADHD-Friendly Strategies

These strategies apply to both technical and non-technical task breakdowns to reduce overwhelm, manage executive function challenges, and promote focus.

### Time Management
- **Pomodoro Technique:** Break work into 25-minute focused sessions followed by 5-minute breaks. Use a timer to enforce boundaries.
- **Time Estimates:** Limit subtasks to 15-30 minutes to maintain momentum and avoid procrastination.

### Task Structuring
- **Done Criteria:** Define concrete "done" indicators for each subtask (e.g., "You are done when...").
- **Sequenced Steps:** Present subtasks logically, with dependencies clear.

### Focus and Distraction Control
- **Distraction Minimization:** Suggest "Do Not Disturb" mode or removing phone access before starting.
- **Focus Locks:** Explicitly state what NOT to do (e.g., "Ignore unrelated code for now").

### Motivation and Support
- **Gamification:** Frame tasks as "missions" or "challenges" to make them engaging.
- **Encouragement:** End with supportive, empowering language to build confidence.

### Breaks and Recovery
- **Scheduled Breaks:** Include "Take a 5-minute break" steps between larger chunks.
- **No Refactoring Detours:** Remind users to stick to the mission and avoid side tasks.

Use these in conjunction with domain-specific breakdowns for optimal results.
