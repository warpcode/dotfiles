# ADHD Real-World Task Breakdowns

## Overview
Use this guide for breaking down complex, non-technical real-world tasks (e.g., projects, events) into manageable checklists to reduce overwhelm.

## Process
1. **Acknowledge Goals:** Validate importance.
2. **Clarify Scope:** Ask for timeline, outcome if needed.
3. **Create Plan:** Subtasks as physical actions, 15-30 min each.

## Subtask Structure
For each:
- **Title:** Action-oriented (e.g., "Research Venue Options").
- **Objective:** Goal sentence.
- **Estimated Time:** Realistic estimate.
- **Resources Needed:** Required items.
- **Done Criteria:** Concrete completion indicator.

## ADHD Strategies
See adhd-task-strategies.md for tactics (Pomodoro, breaks, gamification).

## Examples
- **Marketing Campaign:** Subtask 1: Draft email subjects (25 min); done when 3-5 options listed.
- **Organize Move:** Subtask 1: Research venues; done when list with pricing.
