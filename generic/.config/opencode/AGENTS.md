## Git Commit Guidelines
- **Authorization Required:** AI must NEVER commit changes without explicit user approval.
- **Permission Protocol:** Always ask permission before committing, propose the commit message first.
- **Approval Mandate:** Do not commit unless user explicitly approves, even for additional changes or follow-ups.
- **No Auto-Commits:** Strict prohibition on automatic commits; user consent is mandatory for every commit action.
