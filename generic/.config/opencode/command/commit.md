description: Use this command to generate a diff between the current repository state and the main branch (master if main doesn't exist), then review the changes for inefficient and bad practice code.
---

## Steps

- Ensure we peer review the code and wait for the user to approve.
- Then once approved, confirm the files/changes to be committed.
- Then generate a commit message.
- Then wait for user approval of the commit message.
- Then commit the changes.
