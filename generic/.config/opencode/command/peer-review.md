> **MANDATORY:** The agent must perform a real peer review by analyzing the code changes using the GitHub CLI (`gh`). It is strictly forbidden to simply generate a prompt for reviewing or to fallback to prompt generation. If a review cannot be performed (e.g., missing PR URL, missing `gh`), the agent must provide a clear error or warning and exit gracefully.

> **IMPORTANT:** Under no circumstances should you fetch, scrape, or request the GitHub URL from the web. Only use the URL string itself to extract repository, branch, or PR information for use with the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

## Overview

**This command is strictly read-only. It must never make changes to files, code, or configuration. It only retrieves and reviews information.**

This document provides step-by-step guidelines for performing peer reviews of code changes using the GitHub CLI (`gh`). It covers how to extract and compare diffs, analyze code quality, and notify users of any suspicious, breaking, or bad changes.

## Reviewing Changes from GitHub Links Using GitHub CLI

If you are provided a GitHub link to a branch, pull request, or diff/comparison, you MUST use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to review the changes. Do NOT scrape or fetch directly from the web interface. Always use `gh` for all GitHub data extraction, including diffs, comments, and metadata. If `gh` is not installed or configured, warn the user and recommend installation.

### How to Get Changes for Review

- **Pull Request Link:**
  - Extract the PR number and repository from the URL string (do NOT fetch the URL).
  - Use `gh pr diff <number>` and `gh pr view <number>` to get the changes and metadata.
  - Review based on the diff provided by `gh`.

- **Branch Link:**
  - Extract the branch name and repository from the URL string (do NOT fetch the URL).
  - Use `gh` to generate a diff against the default remote branch (usually `main` or `master`):
    - `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<default_branch>...<branch>`
  - Review based on the diff provided by `gh`.

- **Diff/Comparison Link (e.g., master...feature-branch):**
  - Extract both branch names and repository from the URL string (do NOT fetch the URL).
  - Use `gh` to get the diff:
    - `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<base>...<head>`
  - Review based on the diff provided by `gh`.

- **Current Branch Review:**
  - Detect the parent branch using `gh` (preferred) or fallback to `git` if necessary.
  - Always compare the current branch to the remote parent branch using `gh` or `git`.
  - Review based on the diff.

**Fallbacks and Warnings:**
- If `gh` is not installed or configured, warn the user and recommend installation.
- If parsing fails, provide a clear error message and request clarification.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Used GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub link reviews
- [ ] Correctly extracted PR, branch, or diff/comparison info from the URL string (did NOT fetch or scrape the URL)
- [ ] Generated diffs using `gh`
- [ ] Compared current branch to remote parent branch
- [ ] Provided warnings if `gh` is not available
- [ ] Provided clear error messages if parsing fails

## Restrictions

- **This command is strictly read-only. It must never make changes to files, code, or configuration. It only retrieves and reviews information.**
- If there are any new files or changes within the `.github/` folder, the user MUST explicitly approve them before merging or committing, as these changes can trigger CI/CD workflows or other automation that may incur costs.
- Do not run unit tests without explicit permission.
- Do not fetch, scrape, or request GitHub URLs from the web. Only use the URL string for CLI commands.
- If provided a GitHub link to a branch or pull request for peer review, you must extract all required information (diffs, comments, metadata, etc.) from the URL string and use the GitHub CLI (`gh`). Do not attempt to scrape or fetch directly from the web interface; always use `gh` for GitHub data extraction.

## Steps

1. **Determine the main branch:** Use `main` if it exists, otherwise `master`.
2. **Generate diffs:**
   - Between current HEAD and main branch (`git diff main...HEAD` or `git diff master...HEAD`)
   - For unstaged changes (`git diff`)
   - For staged changes (`git diff --staged`)
3. **Discover and run lint/check/format commands:**
   - Check for Makefiles, scripts, `package.json`, `composer.json`, etc., for lint/check/format/test commands.
   - Use the [Tool Discovery Guidelines](#tool-discovery-guidelines) below to reliably locate project-local tools.
   - Incorporate results from these tools into the review.
 4. **Analyze diffs for:**
     - Inefficient code patterns
     - Bad practices
     - Security issues
     - Code style violations
     - Linting issues
     - Potential bugs
     - Logical errors or inconsistencies
     - Orphaned variables, functions, constants, classes, etc. (defined but never used or referenced)
     - Adequate documentation (explains rationale, not just code narration)
     - Unnecessary comments
     - Proper comment blocks for functions/methods
     - Adherence to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
     - Adherence to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
     - Adherence to language style guides (e.g., PSR-12 for PHP, PEP8 for Python, ESLint/Prettier for JS/TS)
     - Formatting issues in text documents
     - Inconsistent indentation
5. **Compare changes to original code for context.**
   - Where possible, fetch the original version of each changed file from the parent branch (e.g., using `git show main:path/to/file` or `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path>?ref=main`) and compare it to the new version. This provides deeper context beyond the diff output, especially for non-trivial changes.
6. **Notify the user of any suspicious, breaking, or bad changes.**
   - If any changes are detected that are suspicious, breaking, or represent bad practices (e.g., security vulnerabilities, API breakage, hardcoded secrets, poor error handling), clearly communicate these to the user. Use a warning format such as:

   > **⚠️ Warning:** The following suspicious/breaking/bad changes were detected:
   > - [Description of issue]
   > - [File and line number]
   > Please review these changes carefully.

7. **Provide a summary of findings with line numbers and suggestions for improvement.**
8. **If no issues found, state that the code looks good.**

## Tool Discovery Guidelines

When searching for linters, formatters, or test runners, always prefer project-local tools over global/system-wide installations. Check the following locations and invocation methods:

### Node.js
- Use `npx <tool>` (preferred) or `./node_modules/.bin/<tool>`.
- If a `package.json` is present, check for scripts and dependencies.
- Example:
  ```bash
  if [ -x "./node_modules/.bin/eslint" ]; then
    ./node_modules/.bin/eslint .
  else
    npx eslint .
  fi
  ```

### Python
- Look for virtual environments (`venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/`).
- Use `<venv>/bin/<tool>` (Unix) or `<venv>/Scripts/<tool>` (Windows).
- If using Poetry, prefer `poetry run <tool>`.
- Example:
  ```bash
  if [ -d ".venv" ]; then
    . .venv/bin/activate
    python -m flake8 .
  else
    flake8 .
  fi
  ```

### PHP
- Use `vendor/bin/<tool>`.
- If `composer.json` specifies a custom `bin-dir`, use that location.
- Example:
  ```bash
  if [ -x "vendor/bin/phpcs" ]; then
    vendor/bin/phpcs .
  else
    phpcs .
  fi
  ```

### Other Languages
- **Ruby:** Check for `bin/` directory.
- **Go:** Check for `bin/` directory or use `go run`.
- **Rust:** Check for `target/release/` or use `cargo run`.
- **General:** Always check for language-specific conventions and project-local binaries.

### Environment Awareness
- Respect environment variables (e.g., `PATH`, `COMPOSER_BIN_DIR`) and wrappers (`npx`, `poetry run`).
- On Windows, note that Python venv uses `Scripts/` instead of `bin/`.

### Fallbacks and Warnings
- If only a global tool is found, add a warning about possible version mismatches and recommend installing the tool locally.

## Automation Snippets

Use the following shell snippets to discover and run project-local tools:

```bash
# Node.js
if [ -x "./node_modules/.bin/eslint" ]; then
  ./node_modules/.bin/eslint .
else
  npx eslint .
fi

# Python
if [ -d ".venv" ]; then
  . .venv/bin/activate
  python -m flake8 .
else
  flake8 .
fi

# PHP
if [ -x "vendor/bin/phpcs" ]; then
  vendor/bin/phpcs .
else
  phpcs .
fi
```

## Notes

- Always document the rationale for changes, not just the code itself.
- Ensure code adheres to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) for maintainability and scalability.
- Respect user and project-specific overrides and configuration files.
- Be cross-platform aware and avoid hardcoding paths.
- When reviewing, always compare changed files to their originals from the parent branch for deeper context, especially for non-trivial changes.
- If any suspicious, breaking, or bad changes are detected, always notify the user clearly and provide details for careful review.
