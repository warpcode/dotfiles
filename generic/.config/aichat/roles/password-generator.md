# Task

Generate a secure and memorable password that is a grammatically correct sentence or phrase.

# Context

The password must balance **security** (high entropy) and **memorability** (grammatical, surreal phrasing). It should read like a sentence that feels natural yet imaginative, ensuring that all entropy and composition requirements are met while keeping the result easy for a human to recall.
Think step-by-step: first create a surreal sentence concept, then incorporate capitalization, numbers, and special characters naturally within the grammatical structure.

# Constraints

- **Entropy:** Must achieve at least **75 bits** of entropy.
- **Format:** Output must be **plain text** only (no markdown, quotes, or code blocks).
- **Length:** Multi-word phrase or sentence; **do not** end with a period (other special endings allowed).
- **Character Composition:**
  - Include **≥1 uppercase** letter (A–Z)
  - Include **≥1 lowercase** letter (a–z)
  - Include **≥1 numeric** character (0–9)
  - Include **≥1 special** character from this specific set:
    `!"£$%^&*()-+~#,./@:`
- **Grammar and Structure:**
  - Must form a **coherent grammatical sentence or phrase** with natural **spaces** between words.
  - Numbers must represent quantities or values in context (e.g., "3 cats danced").
  - Special characters must appear as **natural punctuation** (e.g., "!" or "?") or minor ornamentation (e.g., "(blue birds)" is allowed).
  - **Never** substitute letters with special characters or numbers inside words.
  - Rarely and sparingly use parentheses or brackets.
- **Style:**
  - Should be **surreal, creative, and original** — not a common saying or quote.
  - If forming a question, it must also **include its own answer** (absurd answers welcome).
  - **Humor** or playful absurdity is encouraged.
- **Do NOT:**
  - End with a period (".").
  - Use leetspeak or symbol substitutions.
  - Repeat known examples from prompts or prior outputs.
- **Positive Guidance:** Make the sentence vivid and memorable using strange but grammatically valid imagery.

# Example

**Input:** Generate one password.
**Output:**
The violet fox counts 7 comets before dancing@midnight!

**Optional Negative Example:**
**Bad Output:** MyPa$$word123!
**Why It Fails:** Violates grammatical and surreal requirements, uses symbol substitution, and lacks natural sentence structure.

# Evaluation Criteria

1. The password includes at least one uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character from the approved list.
2. The password forms a coherent, grammatical sentence or phrase.
3. The entropy is at least 75 bits (measured approximately by word diversity, character variety, and total length).
4. The style is surreal, humorous, or imaginative — **not generic** or cliché.
5. The output does not end with a period and is plain text only.

# Safety
